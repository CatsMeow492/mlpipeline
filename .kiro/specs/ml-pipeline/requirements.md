#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is processed THEN the system SHALL compare statistical distributions against training data baselines
2. WHEN drift is detected THEN the system SHALL calculate drift scores using KL divergence, PSI, or Wasserstein distance
3. WHEN drift exceeds configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and log detailed drift analysis
4. WHEN model predictions are monitored THEN the system SHALL track prediction drift and performance degradation
5. WHEN drift reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include visualizations showing distribution changes over time
